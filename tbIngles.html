            <h3> What is the film about? </h3>
                <h4> The events of this cinematic work take place 30 years after the events of “Top Gun (1986)”. In this new film, a new mission is about to take place in the navy:
                    Destroy an enemy nuclear threat, hidden among hills where drones are not
                    enough and only extreme human skill can arrive. The best of the pilots of a new batch of aces are there, but you need a teacher to
                    handle the classic F-18 fighters. And who is set to be the instructor is Pete “Maverick” (Tom
                    Cruise), who has the reputation of a legend, even though he still is discredited by the
                    senior officers of the armed forces. Upon returning to the team, the pilot is face to face with the
                    Bradshaw (Miles Teller), son of his best friend and former co-pilot, Goose
                    (Anthony Edwards), who died during a combat simulation in which he was partnered
                    with Mav. In the midst of this specialized mission, a rivalry is created between them, while
                    the protagonist needs to relive ghosts from the past to sacrifice himself in another harmful military service                 
                </h4>
            <h3> My Opinion </h3>
                <h4> A film with great visual effects and an exciting and engaging story, it encourages
                    people to follow their dreams, their instincts, to believe that you are capable. the film
                    also shows that Resilience and Teamwork are the keys to success
                    of any problem or mission faced in life, people need to remember that we can't do everything by ourselves, sometimes we need others who can
                    give us the support we need, who can be by our side and help us, our 
                    arrogance and pride can often be our own obstacles.
                </h4>
            <h3> Recomendation </h3>
                <h4> This film is recommended for those who like adrenaline, romance of the typical
                    family drama and obviously, Planes and almost impossible missions. If you are one of those who didn't watch the first film, it's fine, because Top Gun: Maverick 
                    holds up perfectly as a solo film. However, having attended or at least known
                    some points in the history of the 1980s is important to contextualize the relationship of some characters and understand their motivations in the current film
